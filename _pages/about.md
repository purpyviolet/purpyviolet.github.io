I am a sophomore student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at South China University of Technology. My interests lie in the fields of computer vision, physiological signal detection, and affective computing. Currently, I have a GPA of 3.7 out of 4.0. I aspire to pursue a PhD at a university in Hong Kong or Singapore.
