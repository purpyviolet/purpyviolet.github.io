I am an undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at South China University of Technology. My primary interests include:

- **Detection and Processing of Human Physiological Signals**: Focusing on the acquisition and analysis of various physiological signals, with a particular emphasis on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and neurosignal analysis.
- **Classification of Brain Signals**: Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques to classify brain signals from modalities such as EEG (electroencephalogram), fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy), and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging).
- **Brain Signal Encoding and Decoding**: Exploring the transformation of neural activities into diverse outputs, such as images, videos, text, and speech. This involves developing systems that can interpret and generate meaningful information from brain signals.
- **Temporal Network Models**: Investigating the application of temporal network models to understand the dynamic nature of physiological signals and their underlying patterns.
- **Signal Processing Techniques**: Enhancing the quality and interpretability of neural data through advanced signal processing methods.

Currently, I have a GPA of 3.74 out of 4.0.
